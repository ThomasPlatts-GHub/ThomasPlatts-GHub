# Hello All!
<ul>
  <li>
    My name is Thomas Platts and I am an Aspiring Polymath, Engineer and Physicist.
  </li>
  <li>
    My interests span from Arduinos to control robotic systems to understanding the Universe and applying theory to these rules. 
  </li>
</ul>

# What I am Learning
<ul>
  <li>
    I am currently juggling many things such as: <li>
      Studying an Integrated Masters Degree in Physics with The Open University (I am in my second year)
    </li><li>
      Learning the syntax of C++ to be able to learn and code systems with an Arduino (and do some physics simulations) and eventually learn some Python Packages for a Raspberry Pi 5.
    </li><li>
      Understanding basic electronics ranging from (circuits, resistors, diodes etc.), to further better my knowledge in Electrical Engineering.
    </li><li>
      And finally I will eventually be teaching myself further engineering (hopefully with an Internship at some company)
    </li>

</ul>

# What This GitHub Profile Is For
This profile is for me but also recruiters who are interested in hiring. Here are all of my personal projects which i am proud of (these range from learning curves to fully fledged projects).<br>My overall goal in life is to become proficient in Engineering, Physics and Mathematics alongside coding to supplement future projects which i have in mind.
