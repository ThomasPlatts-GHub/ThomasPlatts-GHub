# Quick Note
My heatmap has significantly died down. This is not because i have stopped making projects, I am currently learning extensive C++ and will move to the GLFW library as I want to eventually simulate black holes through C++. Please forgive the gaps in the heatmap.

# Hello All!
<ul>
  <li>
    My name is Thomas Platts and I am an Aspiring Polymath, Engineer and Physicist.
  </li>
  <li>
    My interests span from Arduinos to control robotic systems to understanding the Universe and applying theory to these rules. 
  </li>
</ul>

# Interests
I am currently juggling many things such as:
<ul>
     <li>
      Studying an Integrated Masters Degree in Physics with The Open University (I am in my second year)
    </li>
  <li>
      Learning the syntax of C++ to be able to learn and code systems with an Arduino (and do some physics simulations) and eventually learn some Python Packages for a Raspberry Pi 5.
    </li>
  <li>
      Understanding basic electronics ranging from (circuits, resistors, diodes etc.), to further better my knowledge in Electrical Engineering.
    </li>
  <li>
      And finally I will eventually be teaching myself further engineering (hopefully with an Internship at some company)
    </li>
</ul>

# Current Learning Tech Stack (All under way)
<ol>
  <li>
    Python + Sympy - This is for Symbolic manipulation (e.g. Symbolic integrators, anomaly detectors)
  </li>
  <li>
    C++ with SFML + OpenGL - This is for SImulation & Visual Diagnostics (e.g. Real-time physics simulators, reflex overlays)
  </li>
  <li>
    More Arduino and C++ work - For Embedded Systems & Diagnostics (e.g. Modular sensor loggers, reflex triggers)
  </li>
  <li>
    Rust - For Chaos-Resilient Architecture (e.g. Runtime patchers, config validators)
  </li>
  <li>
    Assembly (x86 or ARM) - Low-Level Runtime Control (e.g. Reverse-engineering runtime behaviour)
  </li>
  <li>
    Haskell or Lisp - Meta-Programming & Abstraction (e.g. Logic interpreters)
  </li>
</ol>

# Main Project
<p>After learning this entire stack (which can range from 6 months-1 year for me) I aim to build a "Reflex Benchmarking & Anomaly Detection Simulator". This is what it would do: <br> 
🔹 Tracks reflexes in real time
  <ol>
    <li>
      Uses Arduino sensors (e.g. IR break beam, pressure pads) to log human reflexes
    </li>
    <li>
      Benchmarks against AI or scripted inputs for comparison
    </li>
    <li>
      Captures reaction time, input precision, and error rates
    </li>
  </ol>
  
🔹 Visualizes performance
  <ol>
    <li>
      Uses SFML/OpenGL to render overlays, input trails, and symbolic annotations
    </li>
    <li>
      Displays live feedback, reaction graphs, and symbolic commentary
    </li>
  </ol>

🔹 Diagnoses anomalies
  <ol>
    <li>
      Uses Python + SymPy to symbolically analyze reflex patterns
    </li>
    <li>
      Flags outliers, delays, and non-physical responses
    </li>
    <li>
      Suggests symbolic causes (e.g. fatigue, sensor lag, config mismatch)
    </li>
  </ol>

🔹 Recovers from runtime chaos
  <ol>
    <li>
      Uses Rust to validate configs, patch corrupted logs, and auto-recover from sensor failure
    </li>
    <li>
      Implements fallback logic trees and self-healing routines
    </li>
  </ol>

🔹 Adds meta-awareness
  <ol>
    <li>
      Uses Haskell or Lisp to build a symbolic recognizer that interprets reflex logs
    </li>
    <li>
      Generates meta-commentary: “Reflex spike at t=2.3s likely caused by anticipatory bias”
    </li>
    <li>
      Tracks symbolic structure of performance over time
    </li>
  </ol>

# What This GitHub Profile Is For
This profile is for me but also recruiters who are interested in hiring. Here are all of my personal projects which i am proud of (these range from learning curves to fully fledged projects).<br>My overall goal in life is to become proficient in Engineering, Physics and Mathematics alongside coding to supplement future projects which i have in mind.
